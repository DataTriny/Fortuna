# Fortuna

Fortuna is a text adventure game I build while learning Rust.

## How to play

Make sure Rust is installed on your system. If it is not already, [visit this page](https://rustup.rs/) and follow the instructions.

To build the game, it's as simply as typing those lines on your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/DataTriny/fortuna.git
cd fortuna
cargo run
```

Have fun!
